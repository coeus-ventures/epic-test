# Help Desk App

A support ticket management application for tracking customer issues and providing assistance.

## Your Task

You are building a web application from scratch. The behaviors in prd.json describe what users should be able to do with the finished app. Your job is to implement all the functionality needed to make those user behaviors work.

## Instructions

Build this application in the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY. Do NOT create a subdirectory.

1. **Initialize the project**: Create package.json, install dependencies (React/Vite recommended)
2. **Read the behavior spec**: Each iteration focuses on one behavior from behaviors/
3. **Implement the functionality**: Build whatever is needed to make that user behavior work
4. **Commit your changes**: Make a git commit after each behavior is complete
5. **Exit immediately**: Do NOT run the dev server - just implement and commit

**IMPORTANT**: The app will be tested separately. Do NOT run 'npm run dev' or start any servers.

## Important Notes

- The behavior specs describe USER actions (navigate, type, click) and expected outcomes
- You must implement the underlying CODE that makes those actions possible
- For example, if a behavior says "Click the delete button", you need to create a delete button and wire up the delete functionality
- Focus on making the app WORK, not on perfect code structure
